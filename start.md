## 1. Objective

* **Purpose:** To document the findings of a preliminary exploration assessing the viability and refining the focus for a potential Ph.D. project titled "Ethical Frameworks and Governance Design for Pro-Poor Artificial Intelligence in the Philippines."
* **Scope of Exploration:** Focused on initial assessment of (a) the availability of relevant Philippine policy context documents and (b) the existing academic/policy landscape concerning pro-poor AI governance and related ethical themes.

## 2. Search Strategy

* **Keywords Used:**
    * *Philippine Context:* [List keywords used, e.g., "Philippines National AI Strategy", "DICT AI", "DOST AI Roadmap", "Philippines digital transformation", "Data Privacy Act Philippines implementation"]
    * *Academic/Policy Landscape:* [List keywords used, e.g., "pro-poor AI governance", "AI ethics developing countries", "AI capability approach", "data justice global south", "distributive justice AI"]
* **Sources Consulted:**
    * [List sources, e.g., Specific Philippine Government websites (DICT, DOST, NEDA), Google Scholar, University Library Database, Semantic Scholar, UN/World Bank websites]
* **Time Period:** Approximately [Number] hours/days spent on this initial exploration.

## 3. Key Findings: Philippine Policy Context (Initial Scan)

* **Identified Documents:**
    * [Document 1 Title, Year, Issuing Body] - *Brief note on relevance/focus.*
    * [Document 2 Title, Year, Issuing Body] - *Brief note on relevance/focus.*
    * [Add more as found]
* **Initial Observations:**
    * [Note key themes observed, e.g., Strong emphasis on economic growth/BPO sector? Mention of specific ethical guidelines? Focus on data privacy vs. broader governance? Apparent alignment with/divergence from global trends?]
    * [Comment on accessibility of these documents - readily available, behind paywalls, etc.?]

## 4. Key Findings: Academic & Policy Landscape (Initial Scan)

* **Identified Key Sources/Authors:**
    * [Author/Paper/Report 1, Year] - *Brief note on core argument/relevance.*
    * [Author/Paper/Report 2, Year] - *Brief note on core argument/relevance.*
    * [Add more key findings, up to ~5-10]
* **Emerging Themes/Debates:**
    * [List key themes identified, e.g., Data colonialism/justice; Importance of contextualizing ethics/fairness; Capability approach applications; Critiques of Western bias in AI ethics; Role of community participation.]

## 5. Viability Assessment & Reflections

* **Information Accessibility:** [Assess apparent ease/difficulty of accessing necessary policy docs and academic literature based on this scan.]
* **Research Gap & Originality:** [Does this initial look support the idea of a gap concerning explicitly pro-poor, ethically grounded AI governance applied to the Philippines? Does the proposed approach seem novel?]
* **Personal Interest:** [Confirm or note any shifts in interest/motivation based on findings.]
* **Identified Challenges:** [Note potential difficulties, e.g., Operationalizing 'pro-poor'; Bridging global theories with local specifics; Potential lack of detailed implementation plans in policy docs.]
* **Identified Opportunities:** [Note encouraging signs, e.g., Active academic debate on related themes; Clear policy interest in digitalization (even if ethics needs more focus); Potential for high impact.]

## 6. Proposed Next Steps

* [List 2-4 concrete next actions based on the findings above.]
    * *Example:* Conduct systematic literature review focusing on [Specific theme/theory] and [Specific aspect of Philippine context].
    * *Example:* Refine Research Question [Number] in the proposal outline to reflect [Specific finding].
    * *Example:* Identify 3-5 potential supervisors based on expertise in [Field X] and [Field Y].
    * *Example:* Draft introductory email to potential supervisors, including this summary document.
